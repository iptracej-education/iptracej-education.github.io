[{"content":" Iâ€™m a former Microsoft security professional, currently on sabbatical to support my spouseâ€™s career advancement while pursuing a Master of Science in Analytics (OMSA) for pursuing my passion for Security AI and ML engineering.\nOur family recently relocated from Seattle, Washington to Dayton, Ohio, where my wife has joined Hondaâ€™s EV engine division. Weâ€™re enjoying life here â€” and in my personal time, Iâ€™m taking steps toward earning a private pilot license.\nProfessionally, I spent 20 years leading security efforts in Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Consulting Services division, gradually shifting my focus from infrastructure security to application and software security.\nIn recent years, while pursuing offensive security certifications such as OSCP, OSWE, and GPEN â€” and actively participating in CTFs and real-world hacking events â€” Iâ€™ve developed a strong interest in the intersection of security and AI/ML engineering, recognizing how these disciplines can meaningfully complement and strengthen each other.\nIâ€™m deeply interested in frameworks that uncover novel and existing attack surfaces, vectors, and paths. My current focus is on integrating knowledge management (TTPs) with large language models (LLMs) to accelerate vulnerability discovery. While human oversight remains vital, I believe that ML models equipped with local knowledge of TTPs can act as catalystsâ€”revealing new angles and exploit chains even seasoned experts might miss.\nMy research interests include:\nLLM-Enhanced Deep Code Reasoning and Multi-Path Vulnerability Exploration Adaptive, Data-Driven Vulnerability Discovery Pipelines Humanâ€“Machine Collaboration in Vulnerability Research With over 20 years at Microsoft leading security efforts, Iâ€™m now channeling that experience into advancing research at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity.\nðŸ‘‹Stay tuned â€” exciting developments ahead.\nYou can find out more via , or just drop me an email via sean at heelan dot io.\nMy Twitter profile is here, and my LinkedIn profile is here.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about/","summary":"\u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/css/resume.css\" /\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"resume-page\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIâ€™m a former Microsoft security professional, currently on sabbatical to support my spouseâ€™s career advancement while pursuing a Master of Science in Analytics (\u003ca href=\"https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics\"\u003eOMSA\u003c/a\u003e) for pursuing my passion for Security AI and ML engineering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur family recently relocated from Seattle, Washington to \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio\"\u003eDayton, Ohio\u003c/a\u003e, where my wife has joined Hondaâ€™s EV engine division.
