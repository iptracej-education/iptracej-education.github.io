Iâ€™m a former Microsoft security professional, currently on sabbatical to support my spouseâ€™s career advancement while pursuing a Master of Science in Analytics ([OMSA](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics)) for pursuing my passion for Security AI and ML engineering.

Our family recently relocated from Seattle, Washington to [Dayton, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio), where my wife has joined Hondaâ€™s EV engine division. Weâ€™re enjoying life here â€” and in my personal time, Iâ€™m taking steps toward earning a private pilot license.

Professionally, I spent 20 years leading security efforts in Microsoft's Consulting Services division, gradually shifting my focus from infrastructure security to application and software security.

In recent years, while pursuing offensive security certifications such as [OSCP](https://www.offsec.com/products/oscp-plus/), [OSWE](https://www.offsec.com/courses/web-300/), and [GPEN](https://www.giac.org/certifications/penetration-tester-gpen/) â€” and actively participating in [CTFs](https://ctf.hackthebox.com/) and real-world hacking events â€” Iâ€™ve developed a strong interest in the intersection of security and AI/ML engineering, recognizing how these disciplines can meaningfully complement and strengthen each other.

Iâ€™m deeply interested in frameworks that uncover novel and existing attack surfaces, vectors, and paths. My current focus is on integrating knowledge management (TTPs) with large language models (LLMs) to accelerate vulnerability discovery. While human oversight remains vital, I believe that ML models equipped with local knowledge of TTPs can act as catalystsâ€”revealing new angles and exploit chains even seasoned experts might miss.

My research interests include: 

- LLM-Enhanced Deep Code Reasoning and Multi-Path Vulnerability Exploration
- Adaptive, Data-Driven Vulnerability Discovery Pipelines
- Humanâ€“Machine Collaboration in Vulnerability Research

With over 20 years at Microsoft leading security efforts, Iâ€™m now channeling that experience into advancing research at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity.
