## **Who am I?**

I’m a former Microsoft security professional, currently on sabbatical to support my spouse’s career advancement while pursuing a Master of Science in Analytics ([OMSA](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics)) for pursuing my passion for Security AI and ML engineering.

Our family recently relocated from Seattle, Washington to [Dayton, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio), where my wife has joined Honda’s EV engine division. We’re enjoying life here — and in my personal time, I’m taking steps toward earning a private pilot license.


## **My background**

Professionally, I spent 20 years leading security efforts in Microsoft's Consulting Services division, gradually shifting my focus from infrastructure security to application and software security.

In recent years, while pursuing offensive security certifications such as [OSCP](https://www.offsec.com/products/oscp-plus/), [OSWE](https://www.offsec.com/courses/web-300/), and [GPEN](https://www.giac.org/certifications/penetration-tester-gpen/) — and actively participating in [CTFs](https://ctf.hackthebox.com/) and real-world hacking events — I’ve developed a strong interest in the intersection of security and AI/ML engineering, recognizing how these disciplines can meaningfully complement and strengthen each other.

## **Current Works**

My research focuses on developing automated frameworks to identify novel attack surfaces and complex exploit paths. Currently, I am investigating how Large Language Models (LLMs) can augment traditional vulnerability discovery in safety-critical systems. 

My research interests include: 

- Architecture Validation: Comparative analysis of Transformer-based models vs. Graph Neural Networks for identifying 'missing check' vulnerabilities in firmware.

- Research: Proposing a new methodology for detecting race conditions in stripped binary firmware by lifting binaries to high-level intermediate representations for semantic analysis.

This work builds upon my 20-year tenure leading security initiatives at Microsoft, bridging the gap between operational security expertise and modern AI innovation.

👋Stay tuned — exciting developments ahead.
